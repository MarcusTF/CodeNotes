# CodeNotes

These are my notes that I've written while learnng JavaScript. I decided to try to write them as if I were attempting to explain them to someone else; that way if I ever feel confused, or need a refresher, I can reference my own notes that explain everything in plain english. Additionally, writing them this way makes sure I actually understand the concept well enough to explain it. I'm making them public so hopefully some people who are having a tough time with these concepts might stumble upon this and be able to get something out of them, and so that I can easily send them to someone else if they want help with any of the topics contained within.

If you run everything and check the console, everything logged there is organized into sections.

I also went ahead and wrapped the whole contents of each file into its own function to contain the scope of the names used within them that might conflict between notes, that way they can all run at the same time and I can use simple, logical names in the notes.
