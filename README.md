# CodeNotes

These are my notes that I've written while trying to learn code. I decided t try to write them as if I were attempting to explain them to someone else; tht way if I ever feel confused, or need a refresher, I can reference my onw notes that explain everything in plain english. I'm making them public so hopefully some people who are having a tough time with these will stumble on this and be able to get something out of them, and so that I can easily send them to someone else if they want help with any of the topics contained within.
